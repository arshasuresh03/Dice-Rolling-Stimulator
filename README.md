# Dice-Rolling-Stimulator
Generates random numbers representing dice faces. Helpful for learning random number generation, basic Python syntax, and simple game development for computer science students.

This Python code simulates rolling a dice using the random module. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

Importing the random Module: The code starts by importing the random module, which provides functions for generating random numbers.

Print Statement: Prints a message indicating that it's a dice stimulator.

Dice Rolling Simulation Loop: The code enters a while loop that continues as long as the variable x is equal to "y".

Generating Random Number: Inside the loop, the random.randint(1, 6) function generates a random integer between 1 and 6, simulating the roll of a dice.

Displaying the Dice Face: Depending on the value of the random number generated, the code prints out a representation of the corresponding dice face using ASCII art.

User Input: After displaying the dice face, the code prompts the user to input whether they want to roll the dice again. If the user enters "y", the loop continues and another dice roll is simulated. Otherwise, the loop exits and the program terminates.


This code provides a simple and interactive way to simulate rolling a dice, allowing users to roll again as many times as they want by pressing "y". It's a fun and educational example of using random number generation and ASCII art in Python.
